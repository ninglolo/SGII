# SGII
The scores of BC, CC, DC and EC methods of all lncRNAs in the LPPI network are saved in files BC_score_allLncRNAs.csv, CC_score_allLncRNAs.csv, DC_score_allLncRNAs.csv and EC_score_allLncRNAs.csv respectively.

When calculating the GIC score, we need to use the external program RNAfold, which requires a sequence length less than 20,000 nt. If the length is too long, RNAfold cannot work. We sorted out the scores of various lncRNAs methods that met the length requirement and saved them as BC_score.csv, CC_score.csv, DC_score.csv and EC_score.csv respectively.
